I'm a junior undergraduate student double majoring in Computer Science Honors and Mathemathics Honors at Purdue University, planning to graduate in May 2026. In my free time, I like to make videos about mathematics, algorithms, data structures, and x86-64 assembly programming. Visit my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ChristinaZhang-c4y) to watch my videos.

Experience
======
* I completed a Digital Forestry Research Internship in Summer 2025. My mentor was Purdue Computer Graphics Professor Yingjie Chen. I developed a web
interface allowing users to upload and analyze drone footage captured under forest canopies. The website integrates a backend deep learning model to identify and extract tree data from uploaded videos. Users can view detailed information for each tree, including an interactive tree visualization and an annotated video. The visualization dynamically displays tree ID, estimated DBH, and positional information when users hover over individual trees. Users can switch between viewing positional data in UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates or Latitude/Longitude. The annotated video visually highlights detected trees along the drone's flight path, displaying each tree's assigned ID and estimated Diameter at Breast Height (DBH). The application also generates a downloadable CSV file summarizing the tree data, along with the annotated video. This tool offers farmers a practical solution to estimate the value of their trees conveniently using drones, without the complexity or expense associated with traditional LiDAR devices. Improved accuracy in DBH estimations through this system could significantly reduce or eliminate the need for manual tree measurements.

* I served as the Head Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for CS 182 Foundations of Computer Science for three semesters (Spring 2024, Spring 2025, Summer 2025).
* I served as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for CS 252 Systems Programming, CS 251 Data Structures and Algorithms, CS 250 Computer Architecture, CS 182 Foundations of Computer Science, and CS 180 Problem Solving and Object-Oriented Programming.

Projects
======
I created an eLearning website for learning algorithms along with Evan Zimmerman, Anthony Wang, and Nathan Schneider. This website includes animated video lessons, written lessons, quizzes, and discussion pages. Topics from Purdue CS 251 (Data Structures and Algorithms) and CS 381 (Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms) are covered in detail. Students can send a request to the Admin to become a Teaching Assistant. Teaching Assistants can answer questions, endorse comments, and delete comments. I also embedded an AI assistant (Hailuo AI), and users can click on the MiniMax logo at the bottom right to bring up Hailuo AI Chat. We support switching between light and dark mode. Loading the website could take a little while since everything used for deployment was free. Check out our website: [https://boileralgorithms.netlify.app/](https://boileralgorithms.netlify.app/)

Honors and Awards
======
I was awarded the Bittinger Data Science Scholarship in 2025. $5,000 was awarded in total for the 2025-2026 academic year. In addition, I won two awards in 2024:

* Outstanding Freshman in Mathematics (awarded to one freshman Math major per year) - Issued by Purdue University College of Science

* ACM Undergraduate TA Award (awarded to one CS UTA in 2024) - Issued by Purdue University Department of Computer Science

Languages
======
Native proficiency in English and Chinese.
