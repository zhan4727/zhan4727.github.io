I'm a sophomore undergraduate student double majoring in Computer Science Honors and Mathemathics Honors at Purdue University, planning to graduate in May 2026. In my free time, I like to make videos about mathematics, algorithms, data structures, and x86-64 assembly programming. Visit my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ChristinaZhang-c4y) to watch my videos.
